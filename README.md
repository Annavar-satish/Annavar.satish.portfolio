# Annavar Satish - Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, hosted on GitHub Pages at [satish.annavar.org](https://satish.annavar.org).

## About

This is a simple, single-page portfolio website built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. It's designed to be clean, modern, and responsive.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive and should look great on all devices.
*   **Animations:** Subtle animations are used to make the website more engaging.
*   **Contact Form:** A contact form is included, powered by Google Forms.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the website.
*   **JavaScript:** For the mobile menu and other minor functionalities.
*   **Google Fonts:** For the "Poppins" font.
*   **GitHub Pages:** For hosting the website.

## Customization

To customize this portfolio for your own use, you will need to edit the following files:

*   **`index.html`:** This is the main file for the website. You will need to edit the content to reflect your own information.
*   **`style.css`:** This file contains some custom CSS for animations and other styles that are not easily achievable with Tailwind CSS alone.
*   **`script.js`:** This file contains the JavaScript for the website.
*   **`Images/`:** This directory contains all the images used on the website. You will need to replace them with your own images.
*   **`CNAME`:** If you are using a custom domain, you will need to update this file with your own domain name.
